# FrontendMentorChallenge
This is my first frontend mentor challenge. I decided to try frontend mentor challenge in order to be able to practice code more often without having to worry about my own designs. 
I hope this will be a good tool to improve my coding capabilities as a hopeful, future frontend developer.
